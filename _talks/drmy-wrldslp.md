Dream researchers have long faced the challenge of automatically annotating large sets of textual
reports describing oneiric experiences in a consistent manner. While algorithms leveraging machine
learning (ML) methods for the automatic analysis of sleep-related physiological data have
remarkably improved, the automatic analysis of dream reports has lagged behind. Aside very few
notable examples, they remain largely based on dated approaches lacking the ability to reason over
the full context of a report and required considerable data pre-processing (e.g., distributional
semantics models or dictionary-based analyses). In this work, we introduce DReAMy (Dream-Report
Analysis Methods with python), a fully open-source python-based toolkit, summarised in Figure 1.
Using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), DReAMy enables the analyses and a fast
annotation of vast numbers of dream reports with respect to emotions and characters in each
report.
