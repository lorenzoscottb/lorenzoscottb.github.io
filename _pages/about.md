I am a multidisciplinary researcher with a background in cognitive science, machine learning, and NLP. Currently, I am a Research Fellow (Scientific Project Officer) at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC), in the digital health unit. My work focuses on explainability and multimodality. In particular, I am interested in integrating graph-based representations and biological domain knowledge within LLMs, and using explainability and mechanistic interpretability to understand the behaviour of multimodal biomedical models and mitigate implicit biases that influence their diagnostic decision-making processes

Before joining the JRC, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Artificial Intelligence Research Group at the University of Sussex, where I also earned my PhD in Informatics. My thesis examined how LLMs and other machine learning models learn to handle linguistic abilities such as compositionality, generalisation, and inference.

Occasionally, I work on problems related to dream analysis, such as adopting LLMs to annotate and analyse dream content for research purposes.
