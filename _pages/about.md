I am a Research Fellow (Scientific Project Officer) at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC). My research focuses on the explainability and multimodality of AI models for healthcare. In particular, I am interested in integrating graph-based representations and biological domain data within LLMs, and using explainability and mechanistic interpretability to understand the behaviour of vision-language biomedical models and mitigate implicit biases that influence their diagnostic decision-making processes.

Before joining the JRC, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Artificial Intelligence Research Group at the University of Sussex, where I also earned my PhD in Informatics. My thesis examined how LLMs and other machine learning models learn to handle linguistic abilities such as compositionality, generalisation, and inference.

Occasionally, I work on problems related to dream analysis, such as adopting LLMs to annotate and analyse dream content for research purposes.
