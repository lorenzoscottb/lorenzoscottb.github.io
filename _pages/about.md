I am a research fellow (scientific project officer) at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC). My research focuses on explainability and multimodality of AI models for healthcare. Before joining the JRC, I was a postdoc in the Artificial Intelligence Research Group of the University of Sussex, where I also obtained a PhD in Informatics, with a thesis on how LLMs and other machine learning models learn to handle linguistic abilities such as compositionality, generalisation, and inference.
