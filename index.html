<h2>Lorenzo Bertolini Agnoletto</h2> 
	<p>Hello, I am Lorenzo, a research fellow at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC). My current research focuses on multimodality and interpretability for biomedical NLP and machine learning, focusing on graph-based representations. I hold a PhD in informatics from the Univesity of Sussex, where I was also an NLP postdoc at the AI Research Group, where my research has focused on problems at the interaction of linguistics and machine learning, such as studying and improving compositional generalisation and inference abilities of different types of NLP models and adopting language models (LLMs) to study dream content. </p>
