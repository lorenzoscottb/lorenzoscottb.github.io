<h2>Lorenzo [Scott] Bertolini [Agnoletto]</h2> 
	<p> I'm an NLP <a href="https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p458303-lorenzo-bertolini">Postdoc</a> in the <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/ai-research-group/index">Artificial Intelligence Research Group</a> at the University of Sussex.
	My main research interests involve compositionality, inference, and applied NLP. I am particularly interested in how graph-based architectures and data can be integrated and exploited to tackle phenomena like compositionality and inference, and building evaluation methods to understand how current large language models (LLMs) deal with these features of language. More recently, I've done some work on applying LLMs to dream reports, and built <a href="https://github.com/lorenzoscottb/DReAMy">DReAMy</a> , an open-source python toolkit to analyse and annotate dream reports, using a variety of LLMs that you can find via my Hugging Face page.</p>
        <p> Before joining The University of Sussex, I obtain a BSc in experimental psychology at the University of Milano-Bicocca, and an MSc in Cognitive Science from the Centre of Mind and Brain Sciences (CIMeC) of the University of Trento.</p>
